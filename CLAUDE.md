- Keep it simple stupid! Write straight forward, don't be smart.
- No fallbacks, no big manipulations
- Before starting a Task, read the PROJECT_STATUS.local.md file
- After finishing a Task, write a PROJECT_STATUS.local.md file
- Use `./run` for all build operations (build, test, package, install, all)
- Run pre-commit on new or changed files
- Fix especially pre-existing issues
- Do not suppress warnings
- If you change the README, first read it carefully. Only do sensible changes.
- Do not restructure the README. You may make little improvements, though.
- Test your implementation with unit or integration tests
- Don't build brittle tests with too many mocks
- Remove old implementations completely - no backward compatibility needed
- Check API documentation for exact method names - don't assume naming patterns
- Local Plugin API Javadoc: `./doc`
- No useless inline comments, i.e. which are just describing what the
  function or variable below does. That's what javadoc and clear naming is for.
- Remove useless inline comments, when you see them.
